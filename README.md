Since I developed the program in class 12 high school in India the bill for reastaurant would be in Rupees.

<h1>Hotel Management System</h1>
This program is a hotel management system developed in class 12 of high school in India. It performs all the basic functions required for a hotel, including reserving rooms, checking in and out guests, keeping track of room availability, managing finances, scheduling housekeeping and maintenance, and more. The goal of the system is to make the hotel staff's job easier and to provide guests with a better experience.

<h2>Features</h2>
The hotel management system offers several features, including:

<ul>
  <li>Room reservation</li>
  <li>Room availability tracking</li>
  <li>Guest check-in and check-out</li>
  <li>Financial management</li>
  <li>Housekeeping and maintenance scheduling</li>
  <li>Restaurant billing</li>
  <li>Laundry billing</li>
  <li>Game billing</li>
  <li>Total cost calculation</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works</h2>
The hotel management system prompts the user to enter their information, including name, address, check-in and check-out dates, and choice of room. Based on this information, the system calculates the total room rent for the guest's stay.

The system also allows guests to order food from the hotel's restaurant, with a menu of items and prices available for selection. The system calculates the total food cost based on the guest's choices and quantity.

Additionally, guests can give their laundry for cleaning, with prices varying based on the type of clothing. The system calculates the total cost of the laundry.

Lastly, the system allows guests to play games with different prices per game. The system calculates the total cost of the games played by the guest.

After all the expenses are calculated, the system produces a sub-total amount, adds a restaurant service charge, and provides the final bill. The user can then enter their account number to close the account.
